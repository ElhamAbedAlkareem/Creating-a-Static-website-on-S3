# Creating-a-Static-website-on-S3
#Overview

In this priject, we will gain hands-on experience with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) by performing several tasks from an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.

The activities include:
1-Creating an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket: We will create a bucket in S3, which will serve as the storage location for the website files.

2-Creating a new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user: This user will have full access to the Amazon S3 service, allowing us to manage the bucket and its contents securely.

3-Uploading files to Amazon S3: We upload the necessary files to our S3 bucket to host a simple website for the Caf√© & Bakery.

Creating a batch file: This file will be used to update the static website whenever we change any of the website files locally. It automates the process of pushing updates to the S3 bucket, ensuring that the latest version of our website is always available to visitors.

This project provides a practical application of AWS services to deploy and manage a static website hosted on Amazon S3.
